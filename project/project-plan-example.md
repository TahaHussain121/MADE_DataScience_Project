Wealth and Education : Urban-Rural Gaps in Brazil

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How Does Access to Education Influence Wealth Disparities in Brazil's Rural and Urban Areas?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of educational access on income disparity in Brazil's rural and urban areas. Using data  for educational metrics such as enrollment rates, literacy levels, and school resources, as well as World Bank income distribution statistics, we will investigate how education corresponds with income levels in various locations. The analysis will include integrating and cleaning data, segmenting it into rural and urban groups, and conducting analyses to determine the association between education and income.

Control variables such as population density and economic activity will be considered to achieve reliable results. The findings will be illustrated by visualizations, such as plots, that reveal differences in education and income between regions. The project's goal is to discover how educational access affects income disparity and provide insights on strategies that could close these gaps. The recommendations will include targeted initiatives for rural education infrastructure, as well as larger economic strategies to eliminate socioeconomic inequality. The findings are likely to help policymakers and stakeholders understand successful approaches to promoting fair development across Brazil's diverse environment.
